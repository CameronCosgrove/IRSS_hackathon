 These should work for both Mac and OS 
 
Make sure you are added as a collaborator and have a PAT (personal access token)
Set a current directory using:
cd /your path/

Clone the hackathon repository using:
git clone <https address> 

The data is now where you set your current directory 
Set the new directory to the downloaded folder with
cd /downloaded git folder path/
Now you have all the files your teammates have and you can use the terminal/CMD to use git!

To update the git folder with the stuff your team mates have added use:
git pull
To commit the files you have changed, first save the files, then use:
git commit  -m “add an informative message to tell your team what you are adding to the repo”
Committing doesn’t update the repository, it just packages up your changes. You send your changes using: 
git push 
You may be prompted to insert your GitHub username and password. You must use your PAT as your password due to GitHub’s new security features 
These are all the commands you will need, all going well.
